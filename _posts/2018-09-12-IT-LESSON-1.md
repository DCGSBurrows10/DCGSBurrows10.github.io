Our first, IT lesson of year 9, and our second lesson of the year. And it started the same way as last year. We had to delete our repositories. It took me while to find out how to delete my repository, but after many unsuccessful attempts I finally manage to complete the task at hand. I then had to create a new one for year 9. I forked Jekyll now and typed in my repository name but there still wasn't any website attached. Many others in the class had that problem, but after some help from Mr.Keen we managed to resolve the issue. Your page wouldnâ€™t work if you had capital letters written into your repository name to create your website. Once I had got a github pages up and running, I went onto google to look at some website themes and I wanted to do my own version of one of them. It was a website with white writing and different shades of blue throughout. I changed my background colour and writing colour using CSS coding. Then after I had done that, Mr.Keen did some coding demonstrations on the board and explained what we were going to do throughout this year.
