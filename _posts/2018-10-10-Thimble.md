    <td>To understand how Mozilla Thimble works, and to engage in learning to use Mozilla Thimble.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Learning a new area of work that was difficult, and continuing on with it when I didn't understand it.</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Asking Mr.Keen to explain how certain areas of the site work that I didnâ€™t understand.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Working productively on my own, on a new topic which I knew very little about.</td>

    <td>Since this was a new topic, I had to get to know and understand how the topic works which took a lot of time out of the lesson. This could have improved how much I learnt, however, it did mean I learnt an entire new part of the IT topic.</td>

    <td>Next time I will find it much easier as I would have already visited this site and begun to understand some of the skills and uses of Thimble. Next time I will also focus on the differences of Thimble and Github to see how I can improve.</td>
